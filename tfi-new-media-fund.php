					<strong>How do you envision to bring story, design and technology together? </strong>

					<p>Do not track explores how the personalization of the Internet affects our life as users, consumers and citizens. What better than a personalized program to answer to that question?</p>
				
					<p>We will mix both experience and investigation simultaneously in order to shed light on this more and more impenetrable universe.</p>
				
					<p>Do not track, will investigate tracking using the trackers' own technology. We will divide our audience in categories thanks to marketing tools and methods. We believe there is much potential in a “one-to-one” personalized experience in a program addressed to everyone. Its tone and form will be resolutely modern, dynamic and accessible to a mass audience. Our unique creative approach is to turn our audience into the subject of the documentary.</p>
				
					<p>The form will always fit with the content. We want to tell our story the same way as web giants do: using mobile phone, social networks or media websites.</p>
				
					<p>Likewise, our intention regarding design is to make the invisible visible. We want Internet users to shine a light on the opacity of Big data economy. Throughout the program, we will use colored dots as a metaphor of online trackers and data. We will show on screen what we know about each Internet user. The content as well as the interface will be personalized in order to create a unique and personal dialogue between the Internet user and the program.</p>
				
					<p>The global idea is to let people experience as much as possible how their datas are collected or used more than explain it. And make the most of every available tools that Internet offers to interact with our audience in order to adapt the program all along the conversation to what they give us.</p>
				
					<strong>What are you looking to achieve by building out your story this way?</strong>
				 
					<p>“Do not track” will show to the audience where their data goes and how it is used. We don’t tell if tracking is good or bad. But we shed light on this impenetrable universe. The goal is to understand how tracking and personalization distort our perception of reality.  We want to show the “bubble” that shapes our digital lives.</p>
				
					Do not track is divided in 2 Phases. The first one is an interactive film that individually addresses each Internet user to reveal “their” t<p>rackers. It promotes “Do not track” and creates the community.</p>
				
					<p>The second phase is a multi-media discussion (email, video, graphics, conferences) between the program and the users. It will begin with tracking in everyday life of Internet users, then explore the monetization of traffic and the economy of data brokers, and finally look at what shape online tracking could take in 30 years. The conversation builds a broader view of online tracking from the personal level up. This gradual approach from micro to macro allows us to reveal the limits of the bubble that surrounds our digital lives.</p>
				
					<p>The webdocumentary “Tracked” will end the online conversation.  It will follow six archetypal characters while they take part in the conversation: an investigative journalist, a data broker, a hyper-connected teenager, a job-hunting youth, etc. “Tracked” will makes use of the episodes of the conversation to dig into the issues faced by the characters and explore the intimate consequences of online tracking and the personalization of the Internet.</p>
				
					<p>We aim at focusing on different aspects of tracking, to allow users to interact with the program as they want, being “simple spectators” or “active contributors”. We want people to forge their own opinions by showing them what happens to their personal information and where their vision of the world could be altered. Asking them questions, helping them realize that the information they give “innocently” can be used in different manners through experience, that’s what we want to achieve more than giving them a unique point of view on a very complex and evolving issue.</p>
				
					<strong>How are you planning to engage with the audience? </strong>
					<p>Do not track is intrinsically an international project designed to reach a wide audience. Although the concepts of privacy and anonymity differ depending on countries and their cultures, this subject concerns everyone.</p>
					<p>The format of the interactive program and the conversation is genuinely engaging. We hope that the way we plan on doing it, in a very simple and intuitive manner will address a wide audience.</p>
					<p>Moreover, the distribution is at the very heart of the program. As we are used to at Upian, in “Do not track”, we work on conception, distribution and communication in parallel. In order to reach an international audience, we will work hand in hand with various medias around the world: we have started discussions with the New York Times in the United States, the BR in Germany or YLE in Finland. We are also looking for influential media partners in France, Germany and Canada. Our partners will be involved in editorial and artistic choices. They will offer to their audience a specific outlook reflecting their own culture. </p>
					<p>Our objective is to reach the audience using embed programs and viral diffusion instead of waiting for Internet users to come to our website. In this program, we are also thinking about the viral tools that can be used to bring some communities to our program. We are working on funny modules addressing different audiences with viral communications. Interactive or video short formats will explore some of the issues we treat and will be broadcast as the conversation advances, to make people aware of the subject. From false e-commerce sites selling you profiles to buy online cheaper, to video parody imagining conversations between human trackers, the idea is to laugh and share.</p>

				<section class="project-content">
					<strong>How do you envision to bring story, design and technology together?</strong> 

					<p>The OAKLAND FENCE PROJECT is a collaborative, large-scale photo fence exhibit, live and online, using documentary photography, video, augmented reality, open data, and vibrant community partnerships to address the problems of a city in decline and help ignite collaborative urban renewal. We want people coming together just as story, design, and technology come together.</p>

					<p>Five- foot tall documentary photographs by Oakland artists are the soul of this project. They tell the story of the city, they map the soul of the urban imagination, the struggles, the challenges, the incredible beauty, the hope of the future. The integrated use of photography, audio/video, data and augmented reality enables us to produce a creative intervention that is desperately needed in this city, where the voices of the people can be heard and civic action can be catalyzed. </p>

					<p>Photo fences around the city disrupt the urban landscape in surprising ways. People stop and look at the big photographs. They talk, they wonder. They hold their phone to the images - and through the technology - are captivated by the subjects coming to life through video, audio, text on screen and data about the issue being explored. They share it with their friends. They can buy the photograph directly from the artist. They can make a donation to the local nonprofit organization working on the issue, or they can volunteer their time. They can get more information or calendar an upcoming event. The data about crisis morphs into data about change. The numbers move as we are moved to participate. The Oakland Fence project is partnered with Four Kitchens Design, Metaio Technologies and Open Oakland, a group of technologists, journalists and city staff collaborating to improve life in the city using open data & web technologies. This collaboration enables us to work with a team of visual artists to tell the stories, design a web/mobile interface and live experience that reflects the power of those stories and connects them to community action in tangible ways. We can map the needs and the neighborhoods, and through the data  - track and share our impact and the changing face of Oakland - as the project unfolds. The project is the stories; the web and production design uplifts those stories and creates an open framework for participation; the technology facilitates hand-to-hand engagement and allows empathy to become right action.</p>


					<strong>What are you looking to achieve by building out your story this way? </strong>

					<p>I love the power of large-scale photography to change how we see our day-to-day world, to magnify what we refuse to see, to provide hope, promise, and create a sense of belonging among strangers.  That’s really why. I also want to prove the concept that art does catalyze change, that artists should be at every table where problem solving is happening, and that a creative economy is essential to life. I hope the Oakland Fence Project is a collective experience that actually gains in value and meaning as it is shared. The opposite of the Facebook like or the retweet – where stuff lessens in value as it goes viral. “Here, you should read this because I don’t have time, and by the time you see it, it’s probably over anyway.” Social storytelling must be about people. We need more people coming together live and online, taking up cameras instead of guns, finding our way out of violence, poverty and hunger through the sheer force of our collective commitment to it, fortified by the creative imagination of an engaged public.</p> 

					<strong>How are you planning to engage with the audience? </strong>

					<p>Audience engagement with the Oakland Fence Project happens on multiple levels. </p>

					<ul>
					
						<li> 
							<h4> MEDIA ARTISTS AND TECHNOLOGISTS</h4>
							<p>Artists are the first audience. From the very beginning, every Oakland artist submitting work to the fence is a participant, and because of a modest entry fee, they are defacto supporters. We further engage them by encouraging a partnership with a nonprofit prior to submitting work, and incentivize them to articulate their own photographer/filmmaker/musician collaborations that can come to life through the exhibit. Through a partnership with the Oakland HUB and Open Oakland, open code technologists can also apply to weekend Fence hacks so we can layer as much valuable public data into the images as possible.</p>
						</li>
				
						<li> 
							<h4> OAKLAND RESIDENTS AND VISITORS</h4>
							<p>After the Fence is open to the public, it is designed to provide an experience that will engage people’s creativity, move them and enable them to turn the metrics of crisis into dynamic evidence of resilience. As people view the photographs, they can immediately and viscerally connect with the people in them through video and audio stories, music and layered text on screen. Then, through live data feeds also accessed via the app, they can see the scale and scope of the issue in the community. At that moment, they can engage by purchasing the photograph on the spot, volunteering time to the sponsoring nonprofit, making a contribution of cash, or sharing their own story in the digital fence. We hope a “give what you can” experience crosses demographics and is inclusive of everyone in Oakland regardless of race, class, gender, orientation, or status of any kind.</p>
						</li> 
				
						<li> 
							<h4> PERFORMING ARTS ORGANIZATIONS</h4>
							<p>Oakland performing arts organizations are another core audience for the fence, and we will be working with them to curate our Meet Me At The Fence summer series of live music, spoken word, theater and dance performances using the fence as a backdrop and inspiration. </p>
						</li>
				
						<li> 
							<h4> STUDENTS</h4> 
							<p>Students are another core audience: we will be engaging the K-12 community through a “photo makers curriculum” that gives students and all types of educators the tools + tactics necessary to create meaningful photo fence content at their schools and online. We will also be training youth docents to do fence tours + talks at Jack London and in neighborhoods around the city.</p>

					<strong>How do you envision to bring story, design and technology together?</strong>

					<p>When we began developing the Quipu Project we realized one of the distinct narrative challenges our project faced was finding a way to go beyond telling a story “about” those affected by the Peruvian sterilization policy, but to tell a story “with” them. At the heart of the problem lied the issues of abuse and neglect and we were committed to think hard on how not to replicate to the best of our abilities the methods through which media either ignores or exploits the stories of hard to reach communities without any explicit benefit for the subjects of the story.</p>
					<p>The people affected by the Peruvian sterilization policy are mostly illiterate, living in rural or urban marginal areas geographically dispersed all across the country, and whose access to media is almost exclusively through radio and phones. So our starting point was to first of all acknowledge these specific set of constraints, so that the story could be created and experienced by the contributors themselves. This set of cultural and social characteristics, became conditions of possibility when we integrated them from the beginning in the design process. The strong oral culture and the relatively widespread availability of phone communication, either mobile or fixed, led us into building a system of interactions based on audio across the digital divide using radio, phones and web technologies.</p>

					<p>In this way, the central vision of the project formed around the idea of a ‘living documentary’.  The idea was to enable the creation of a collective story by providing the conditions for the story to emerge, rather than simply “recording” it through a more traditional documentary approach.</p>

					<p>The testimonies shared will be simultaneously available on the phone line and through the web in audio form, allowing the participants to contribute to the narrative from both ends of technology. The project will thus create new methodologies by which people with little or no technical access can be equal participants in the process of making and accessing a documentary.</p>

					<p>To build the web interface we are taking inspiration from the Quipu. The Quipu is an ancient device made of threads and knots that the Inca's used to record collective oral stories. Its literal meaning in fact is Talking Knots. So in our interface, every testimony shared through the phone line becomes a thread, and every response from the web audience is added to the Quipu as a knot.</p>

					<strong>What are you looking to achieve by building out your story in this way?</strong>


					<p>Crucial to our idea of a living documentary, and the methodology we have developed to produce it,  is to harness the democratizing power of the Internet for the benefit of people who remain excluded from the digital world. By developing a repository of stories and testimonies, a sort of ‘offline webpage’, which people can contribute to through both high-tech (on-line) and low-tech (off-line) means, we expect that the collected material can be simultaneously available at the phone line and through the web in audio form, allowing the participants to contribute to the narrative from both ends of technology. In the long term, we believe this project has the potential to transform the historical memory of this case, from elite-driven towards participatory processes.</p>

					<p>It is important for us to stress that the Quipu project is not giving these women ‘a voice’, far from that we are the ones who are joining processes that were already taking place. These women have a voice and in many cases they have been speaking about what happened to them for more than 15 years, the only problem is that until now they haven’t been heard by many.</p>

					<p>In this sense, the central aim of the project lies in encouraging a meaningful dialogue in two directions: among those affected, and between those affected and the world. This kind of participatory projects have  a long tradition, probably the most notable is the Fogo Island Process that gave birth to the Challenge for Change programme promoted by the NFB since the 1960’s.  This form of dialogue is possible because it is driven by the people affected by the sterilization policy as they find the strength to continue their fight for justice. By widening the conversation, audiences will engage with the intimate human experience that is being shared. We have already witnessed, in our prototype project, the way in which women were energised by the process of giving their testimony through a phone, listening to it, and knowing that it was being shared publicly. </p>

					<p>Of course, many challenges lie ahead. Most crucially, to explore the digital medium in the crossover with offline media (radios and mobiles) to achieve a narrative form that expands the stories and trigger new possibilities of what an interactive documentary can be. </p>


					<strong>How are you planning to engage with the audience? </strong>

					<p>The contributors of these stories are also the first audience of the project. Most people affected by the sterilisation policy live in rural areas and don’t have access to Internet or new media technologies. So in order to make them active parts of the interactive experience we need to build a system that can bridge the digital divide through a combination of analog and digital media, local and global media. Our first prototype has allowed us to connect contributors in rural areas of Peru to participate by calling a free local phone number where they can share their stories and also listen to the stories shared by others. At first we were concerned if the technical quality of the shared testimonies would be enough and we didn’t even know if the women from the communities would feel comfortable sharing their stories through the phones. What we have found is that this simple mechanism is able to trigger testimonies with great expressive quality: the emotion and narrative rhythm of spoken word relates more to a very intimate documentary interview than what would be expected from a phone call. It is the st</p>rength of a an ancient oral culture, that has known how to convey knowledge through spoken words across ages that becomes alive once again.

					<p>There will be a parallel experience for the web audience, who will engage with these voices and find they can actually be part of this dialogue, either by simply acknowledging they have listened or by adding their own personal response. Quipu in fact means Talking Knots, so the main metaphor for the interface design is based on threads, knots and branches growing collectively a threaded structure in which audio testimonies and responses from the web audience are weaved together. The responses will not only be included in the web interface, they are carried back to the contributors in Peru through the same phone line and the dialogue goes on. In this sense, we expect the living documentary experience to grow and evolve to make the story happen in directions we can’t foresee at the moment.</p>
					<p>Both experiences connected, responding to each other, is what we expect will make the Quipu Project a distinct interactive experience.</p>

				<section class="project-content">

					Did you experience any challenges in bringing story, design and technology together? If so, please describe. (400 words maximum)

					Our biggest challenge in the development of the Action Switchboard has been replicating the process of brainstorming, creating, and launching creative political actions, which are central to the Yes Men tactics documented in the film. These processes are by nature intuitive and messy and for those going through the process for the first time, it can seem daunting.

					In reality, creative action development is nonlinear–we go back and forth from brainstorming to drawing board to production throughout the entire course of a project. But to make this process accessible and replicable, the Action Switchboard, by design, must present it as a linear narrative, often simplifying what is otherwise complex. 

					In order to do this without reducing the value of a dynamic process, a section of the Action Switchboard is devoted to our Cookbook. This will be a series of articles and videos that catalogues the collective wisdom we’ve accumulated over our years of mischief, and that will continue to reflect lessons learned in new schemes for sharing with the entire Action Switchboard community. We will also offer users outtakes and extended scenes from The Yes Men Are Revolting to further illustrate the behind-the-scenes work that goes into producing a successful media action. Additionally, the project–or “scheme”–pages themselves will tell the stories of the actions featured in the film. We’ve designed these scheme pages so that participants can not only ask for help on their own projects but also record the process of creation for others to learn from and expand on. 

					To further address our teaching challenge, we’ve also made sure that the Action Switchboard is based primarily on human interaction, with Yes Lab facilitators (or “Switchboard Operators”) overseeing many elements of the platform. In order for actions to happen, real live human beings review a proposal and communicate directly with the participants. While we are stockpiling our advice in written form, we are also developing a system of facilitation that will help guide schemes towards the light of day.



					Why did you choose to build your story the way you did and how does it engage with the audience in a unique way? (400 words maximum)


					The Yes Men Are Revolting connects audiences with the personal lives of the Yes Men, compelling characters and veteran activists who bring humor, joy, and art into their struggle for a better world. We follow Mike and Andy as they pull off outrageous interventions for environmental justice while overcoming difficult internal and interpersonal struggles. The story sheds light on how we can all find the will to keep on fighting; as our climate changes and we inch closer to an unknown future, we’ll need everyone to pitch in.

					The film’s hilarious personal story ends with an urgent call to action—and with an exceptional new tool, the Action Switchboard, that will help viewers answer that call. This digital platform allows anyone to initiate and join direct actions to hold powerful institutions accountable for environmental abuses; it also provides in-depth training and resources to help put important issues into the spotlight. The Action Switchboard invites the film's audience to join in the story of the film and extend it in new and powerful ways.

					The media actions featured in the film are not created in a vacuum. Masterminding public spectacles, crashing conferences, and creating fake websites would just be flashes in the pan without the work of other campaigners and activists, who use the momentum these actions generate to make real change. The Action Switchboard allows the film’s audience to learn more about each of the actions featured in the film, as well as many additional actions, and to connect directly with NGOs fighting for issues they care about. They are also offered a chance to connect with new partners and instigate actions on their own, with guidance from our veteran facilitators.

					By allowing the audience to engage with the same stories they saw in the film on the Action Switchboard and see how others are building their own actions, we demystify the process of creation and invite them to get involved–and then share their own transformative process with the world. We built the platform to encourage a snowballing of enthusiasm and political action.

The Action Switchboard (ASB) is designed to harness the energy and interest the film generates to instigate an explosion of real-world creative action in the streets around the world. The ASB forms the backbone of our impact strategy, which also includes flagship screenings in major cities, targeted screenings for frontline communities, and independent self-organized Yes Clubs. In each case, our goal is to use the film to convert audience members to active ASB users, contributing time and resources to new creative actions.

					Alongside facilitating independent schemes, one of the major aims of the ASB is to connect users with NGOs that share their concerns, and allow NGOs to promote campaigns on our platform. Our impact strategy for the film will do the same, focusing on building connections between audience members and NGOs working to address urgent local issues. By facilitating the creation of a Smart Network -- a dense core of overlapping activist groups surrounded by a periphery of supporters -- the ASB adapts a critical aspect of activists’ success, person-to-person relationships, to a digital space to generate world-changing projects on a massive scale.

						•	How do you envision to bring story, design and technology together?
						•	What are you looking to achieve by building out your story this way? 

					----

					Our approach to storytelling has always been to find the story first. 

					We break the overall narrative into interesting, meaningful, emotional pieces. Our main intent is to create an immersive experience in a digital space - an area that typically challenges true immersion and concentration. 

					Technology is the vehicle through which the narrative is delivered, but since it can also serve as a distraction, we spend time making the technology serve the overall narrative, and hopefully, disguising or otherwise making the mechanism invisible. Much of this is taking the more out-of-the-box technical solutions and bending them a bit to make them do the things our storytelling requires. 

					Our design and aesthetic are another way we attempt to mitigate the challenges posed by a digital space, which by its nature is cold, perfect, almost inhuman; we ask ourselves constantly - can we craft something that is by turns beautiful, memorable, powerful? If we can do all this, our connection to an audience can become meaningful, and our story can become their story.

		Updates on your project description on
		TFI
		 Website.

		Using the power of the 12-year longitudinal documentary AMERICAN
		PROMISE as a launching pad, the Promise Tracker mobile app and project website empowers parents and caregivers with strategies
		 to narrow the racial achievement gap in education. Backed by research and a proven methodology, the app allows parents and caregivers to set, monitor, and share goals that support and improve children’s social, emotional, and academic well-being.
		In addition to the Promise Tracker, the American Promise website was created as a space to connect, communicate, and build with key stakeholders. It integrates
		 user polling, extensive unseen video content from the film, resources, and tools that help individuals take action and remain connected to the film its story.

		The site and app are part of the broader community engagement campaign designed by the AMERICAN PROMISE documentary team.
		The	film follows two African-American
		 boys and their families for 12 years as they navigate the terrain of race, privilege and opportunity at a rigorous New York City private school.
		 The campaign mobilizes families, educators, and young people to participate in conversations and actions that better serve black boys and ensure that all young people are equipped with the same opportunities for excellence.
		Since its debut and award at Sundance 2013, the film has been released theatrically in over 40 cities, had a successful broadcast premiere on POV with unprecedented viewership, and received over 1400 screening requests. The filmmakers have published a companion book,
		Promises Kept, and continue to participate in an ambitious engagement campaign that partners with organizations and individuals throughout the country.

		Why did you choose to build your story the way you did and how does it engage with the audience in a unique way? (400 words maximum)
		Americanpromise.org picks up where the film leaves off; providing
		 a practical resource for parents/caregivers to help their sons overcome the education opportunity gap.
		We wanted to create a compelling experience for our audience. We wanted to match the level of intimacy, vulnerability and personal connection that
		 made our film and its story successful, and to provide a place where our target audience could engage, find solutions and be in dialogue with us.

		We conducted extensive research on our target audiences prior to building, exploring the most impactful ways to reach them, and identifying what they needed
		 and would respond to. It was important to meet our viewers where they are, so a digital tool makes sense. Since our film spans 12 years, we had extensive unused footage, and decided to find a creative way to integrate it into our website. Sharing this content
		 online creates an opportunity to be in an ongoing dialogue with visitors. 

		How did the integrated cross-platform or interactive component help engage and activate audiences? (400 words maximum)
		We believe it provides another way for individuals to find themselves in this story and connect with it. Since we are trying to reach parents and educators,
		 it is important to be wherever they are. Our cross-platform approach begins with the film, but includes a book, community screenings and events, and digital tools designed for each stakeholder. The approach provides something for everyone. We recognize that
		 in order to be successful, we must reach parents, educators, and young people, and inspire them to join the conversation and share information.
		We are launching the mobile app in the Summer, and hope that it will immediately link our audience members to our campaign, to manageable solutions
		and to one another. Our broader campaign goals target long-term behavior change goals, so interactive elements help us build lasting relationships with
		 audience and easily track their progress over time.
