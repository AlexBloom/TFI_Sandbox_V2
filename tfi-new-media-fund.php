					American Promise follows filmmaker-parents who spend 12 years with the camera turned on themselves and another African American family as their firstborn sons enter a prestigious college preparatory school in 1999. An intimate, poignant and complex portrayal of how race and privilege are experienced by African American middle class families today.

					To further the work of the film, the team is creating a web series and a goal-setting mobile app called Promise Tracker, which is supported by the TFI New Media Fund.</p>
