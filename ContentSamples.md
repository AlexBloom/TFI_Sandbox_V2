American Promise
American Promise follows filmmaker-parents who spend 12 years with the camera turned on themselves and another African American family as their firstborn sons enter a prestigious college preparatory school in 1999. An intimate, poignant and complex portrayal of how race and privilege are experienced by African American middle class families today.
To further the work of the film, the team is creating a web series and a goal-setting mobile app called Promise Tracker, which is supported by the TFI New Media Fund.

EMOTIONAL ARCADE

The Emotional Arcade engages technology to allow people to play competitive games using their own emotions.  The Arcade is an attempt to provide at least one space on the planet where unrestrained emotional outbursts are honored, and celebrated. 

What are we if not our emotions? In a world that increasingly limits sponteneous emotional expression, the installation creates a space for personal revelation. It’s  a chance to explore the patterns of feeling in a fun way. And everyone who plays gets a lollypop.
