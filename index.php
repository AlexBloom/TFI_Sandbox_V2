				We continue to be excited and inspired by the growing field of interactive storytelling. We started working with the Ford Foundation on the TFI New Media Fund in 2011. Since then we have been funding projects as well as growing the community around this work through Tribeca Hacks and TFI Interactive.  This second iteration of the Sandbox is all about sharing the projects with you as well many of the people we have met and all the things we have learned along the way. Dive in.

					<h3>Discover</h3>
					<p>While gathering contributions for this new edition of Sandbox, I started to feel excited and somehow helpless. I was overwhelmed by the multitude of ground-breaking technologies and platforms that are created as well as the profusion of compelling stories that are told; and many more imaginative ways to create impact and engage audiences, offering a fully interactive and sometimes even immersive experience. When and where does it end? How does one embrace the whole field? Impossible! </p> 
 <p>
 					That’s part of the beauty and the magic of the interactive storytelling landscape. How can we expect to find clear limits when we constantly ask creators to push the boundaries? Feeling helpless can actually be a good way to approach interactive and cross-platform projects:  it makes you humble, curious and open to new experiences.</p>
 
					<p>Rather than trying to define the boundaries of this ever-changing field, we proposed an overview of engaging, interactive and innovative projects we funded, projects we liked, projects people we like liked, knowing that there is an infinite number of inspiring projects out there that we could have talked about. How exciting!</p>
					<p>So, please enjoy, create and innovate!</p>

					<h3>Participate</h3>
					<p>We were thinking about how our work with the Fund fits into the wider digital media ecosystem, and about what we can learn from people who are thinking hard about some of the same problems we are thinking about: how to bring filmmakers and technologists together to create new kinds of work; how to capture the attention of audiences in a highly media-saturated environment and truly engage them; how to innovate while still making sure that the story leads; and how to bring craft and skill to interactive storytelling, building new kinds of experiences that are rich, immersive and compelling. TFI Interactive and the Interactive Playground is the result of this.</p>
 
					<p>Discover what happens at Tribeca Hacks, when storytellers, developers and designers come together to create prototypes over just a few days. These hackathons and workshops give creative media artists the insight and skills to create robust interactive projects that effectively engage with audiences and the chance to experiment with new tools and technologies. They also showcase innovation in this field for artists, funders and the public. A primary goal of Tribeca Hacks is to build new relationships between media artists, technologists and designers.</p>

					<h3>Build</h3>
					<p>In a highly-competitive world of ever changing media creation, more storytellers are curious about creating interactive content but don’t know how to build. Here, we’ve combined information from leading new media creators on how to start, build and sustain these projects.</p>
