#TFI Sandbox File Structure

- All of the templates use php includes to keep everything organized and prevent duplicate static pages.
- If you want to edit a project or piece of content, dive into the folders for each section under the "inc" folder. Update that content and it will be redistributed everywhere through the whole site.
- If you need to edit the order of projects, or add a project to a section, you will need to edit the pages in the main directory.
